# Miramar Swim Lessons

## Setup

Edit the website by eiting [docs/README.md](docs/README.md)

This site uses [Docsify](https://docsify.js.org), which lets you write your website as plain text.

If you want to do formatting/ headings etc, you can use "markdown". Have a look at some cheat-sheets to see how to use it:
- https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet
- https://www.markdown-cheatsheet.com
- https://markdown.land/markdown-cheat-sheet

If you are a programmer and want to develop locally, run:

```js
npm i -g docsify-cli
docsify serve docs
```

## Deploying updates

This [Github](www.github.com) repo is set up to generate a "github page". i.e. the `main` branch gets turned into a website that Github hosts for free.
