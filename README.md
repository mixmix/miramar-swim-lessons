## Setup

This site uses [Docsify](https://docsify.js.org), which lets you write your website as plain text.

If you want to do formatting/ headings etc, you can use "markdown". Have a look at some cheat-sheets to see how to use it:

## Deploying updates

This [Github](www.github.com) repo is set up to generate a "github page". i.e. the `main` branch gets turned into a website that Github hosts for free.
